## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond to numbers:
- **Basic usage**: Make sure you're in a voice channel when typing
- **Tagging usage**: Ensure the mentioned user exists and is in a voice channel
- Verify the bot has proper permissions in your server
- Check that taunt files exist in the `taunts/` folder with correct naming (1.ogg, 2.ogg, etc.)

### "Taunt file not found" error:
- Ensure audio files are in `.ogg` format
- Check file names match exactly: `1.ogg`, `2.ogg`, ..., `105.ogg`
- Verify files are in the `taunts/` directory relative to your bot script
- Make sure you have all taunt files you want to use (bot will tell you which ones are missing)

### Audio doesn't play:
- Verify the bot has "Speak" permission in voice channels
- Check that your audio files aren't corrupted
- Ensure the voice channel isn't full or restricted

### Mention feature not working:
- Check that `ENABLE_DISCORD_MENTIONS=true` in your `.env` file
- Verify the mentioned user exists on the server
- Ensure the mentioned user is currently in a voice channel
- Use the correct format: `number @user` or `@user number`

### Connection errors:
- Verify your `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correct in the `.env` file
- Check that the bot is invited to your server with required permissions
- Ensure your bot token hasn't expired or been regenerated
